Before running on a browser:

    1. Download all jpg's
    2. Download the stylesheet (styles.css)
    3. Depending on your desktop settings and where you place the files, the images may not appear. Although unlikely, if this happens you'll need to edit the code for each image, changing the value for src according to where you place the images on your computer. Ex. if they're in a folder called 'media', you may need to change the src to ' src="../media/first.jpg" ' and so on for the other two image src values.
