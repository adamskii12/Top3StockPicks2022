<h1>Top 3 Stock Picks for 2022</h1>
<p class="pAuthor">Written by Adam I.W., January 12, 2022, 4 min. read</p>
<p class="pIntro">As we proceed into the new year, investors may be wondering if 2022 could be a repeat of the historic gains we saw in 2021. With ongoing economical concerns such as global supply shortages, inflationary fears and further coronavirus effects, we can say one thing for certain: 2022 is going to be volatile. However, all eyes will be on the <abbr id="US" title="United States of America">U.S. </abbr>Federal Reserve as we await the inevitable increase of federal interest rates. Will the Reserve raise rates too fast/too much? Will we see sustained high level of inflation? Will we suffer further harm from new and ongoing coronavirus variants? Nobody knows, but in the long run, these are <strong>my</strong> top 3 stocks that I'm invested in for 2022 and beyond.</p>
<br>


<h2 class="h2Affirm">3. Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM)</h2>
<img title="Affirm Holdings Inc." class="affirmPic" src="third.jpg" alt="Affirm Holdings Inc.">
<p>Affirm is a <abbr title="Buy Now Pay Later">BNPL</abbr> (Buy-Now, Pay-Later) service that allows you to buy goods in instalments over time as opposed to paying the full amount upon purchasing. The company has established numerous partnerships with major online retailers such as Amazon (<abbr title="United States of America" >US</abbr>), Target, Apple (Canada), and Peloton, which all offer Affirm's payment options at customer checkout.  As of today, its share price is trading at $81.24, 54% below its all-time high of $176.65 in November 2021, making it a strong buy from both a fundamental and technical standpoint. With <abbr title="Year-Over-Year">YOY</abbr> revenue growth of 55% and its renown partnerships with prestigious online retailers, Affirm is poised to have a solid year with significant potential for growth in the years to come. </p>

<img title="Fobi AI Inc." class="fobiPic" src="second.jpg" alt="Fobi AI Inc.">
<p>Fobi is a data intelligence company that helps businesses and individuals turn real-time data into actionable insights. They have a wide range of products and services, such as their <em>CheckVax</em> vaccination authenticator and their enhanced digital wallet, the <em>Wallet Pass</em>. They've also made numerous partnerships with renown tech and online retail firms such as Shopify, Amazon, Lightspeed, and many more that incorporate Fobi's technologies. The stock price is currently at $1.24, 68% below its high of $3.93 from just two months ago, making for a significant discount. As businesses and corporations around the world continue their transitions into the digital space, I believe Fobi is in an incredible position to capitalize and has immense potential for growth in 2022 and beyond.</p>

<h2>1. Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN)</h2>
<img class="pennPic" src="first.jpg">
<p>Penn National Gaming is one of the largest casino operators in the <abbr title="United States of America">U.S. </abbr> with over 40 properties across 20 states. Aside from its brick-and-mortar casinos, Penn is rapidly growing their online gaming presence. 
<p>The company owns a majority stake in <em>Barstool Sports</em>, a digital sports media company with a prestigious brand and a substantial fanbase across North America. Barstool offers both online sports betting and casino gaming in 11 states, with plans on expanding as legalization permits. They've grown exponentially over recent years, with its sportsbook maintaining meaningful market share with minimal spending on marketing.</p> <p>In addition to Barstool, Penn also recently acquired <em>Score Media and Gaming</em>, a Canadian sports media company with an immense user base and a reputable brand. Its infamous 'theScore' app is the #1 most downloaded sports app in Canada and #2 in the <abbr title="United States of America">U.S. </abbr>. They also offer online sports betting and casino gaming, but only currently in 4 states. However, theScore will soon be launching their online sports betting services in Ontario, where it's poised to benefit from its already large user base.</p> <p>In terms of the online gambling sector, Penn differentiates themselves with its approach to marketing, as their established brands and follower bases allows them to spend minimal amounts on advertising and customer acquisition, as opposed to their competitors in the space. As of today, Penn is trading for $47.44 per share, down a whopping 67% from its high of $142 set in March of 2021. With the immense attractiveness of both the fundamentals and technicals, Penn National Gaming is my #1 stock pick for 2022 and many years to come.</p> </p>
